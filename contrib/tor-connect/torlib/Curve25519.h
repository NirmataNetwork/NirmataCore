 * More information about curve25519 can be found here

 *
 * djb's sample implementation of curve25519 is written in a special assembly
 * language called qhasm and uses the floating point registers.
 *
 * This is, almost, a clean room reimplementation from the curve25519 paper. It
 * uses many of the tricks described therein. Only the crecip function is taken
 * from the sample implementation.
